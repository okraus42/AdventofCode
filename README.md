WARNING: Extremely low quality code that barely works.
I hope to improve it when I have better idea of what I am doing, but I needed the answers as fast as possible. I have learned a lot during advent of code and more importantly I have learnes what I need to learn. working with graphs and learning memory management in recursive functions.
Working on solutions in C, C++ and Python.
